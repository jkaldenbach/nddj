            Welcome to my website!  This section will tell you everything you need to know about me, your DJ.  I have a Masters in Business degree, and have owned my 5-star DJ business since 2009.  But, what really sets me apart from all other DJ companies is that I run a one man business.  While other large DJ companies will surprise you with a random DJ on the day of your event, I am the one person who will help you plan your special day, help you select music, and will be the one actually DJing for you when the big day arrives!  This gives you the confidence that your event will be given the care and special attention it deserves, without the surprises.  Also, in case you are wondering if I have certain songs, the answer is yes.  My music library consists of over 300,000 songs from the 40’s and 50’s, all the way to the Top 40 songs of the 2010’s.  I encourage everyone I entertain for to relax and enjoy their special day, as I handle all the details for you.

                My company is a unique DJ service that provides the full entertainment package for Weddings, Parties, Karaoke, Dances, or anything that needs music and announcements.
                I am hired often because of my microphone voice and my ability to keep the dance floor full all night.
                I am flexible as well, adapting to music requests and the special needs for each event. I have considerable experience, having DJ’ed for over 300 events, from small groups of people to crowds in the thousands.

                While many DJ’s are still on older systems with CD’s, my system utilizes a “Search” function of over 300,000 songs, which allows me to find any song that is requested in under 10 seconds.  Every event I DJ comes with a Free LED Light Show.  You can see pictures of my lighting and equipment on this site.  I use nothing but efficient state-of-the-art equipment.  I have 5,000 watt speakers with bass, wireless and wired microphones, a fog machine, karaoke equipment, and uplighting.  Also, I have a projector to use at any event for no extra charge.
